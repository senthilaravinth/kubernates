 For Example if a scenario is on Digital Wallet Reward what are the things need to be changed in the existing code

The setup files (pom.xml, Dockerfile, deployment.yaml, and Jenkinsfile) are fully reusable. Focus only on identifying the main nouns (objects) and verbs (actions) of the new problem, and replacing them into App.java and AppTest.java.


Phase 1: Problem Understanding

1. Read the problem twice: First to understand the story, then to find specific rules (like "minimum balance" or "maximum points"). Let these rules guide the tests.
2. List the Nouns: Identify the physical or digital items. For a Digital Wallet, nouns are UserWallet and Transaction. Write these down before opening App.java.
3. Keep logic simple: Use basic if and else statements. Code needs to be readable and functional, not overly complex.
4. Build piece by piece: Write one class, then write one test for it, and run the test. Small steps prevent large errors.
5. Trust the pipeline: If Jenkins or Docker workflows fail suddenly, it is almost certainly a typing error in the Java code. Do not change the pipeline files unless specifically instructed.


Phase 2: Necessary changes need to be done in code

Step 1: Identify Domain Models (The Nouns)
Look at the problem statement to find core entities.
For the Digital Wallet, use UserWallet and Transaction. Open App.java, delete the old static classes, and write new ones. 


            CHANGES IN NOUN CODE                               

            public static class UserWallet {
                private String userId;
                private double balance;
                private int rewardPoints;
            }

            public static class Transaction {
                private double amount;
                private String type; 
            }




Step 2: Identify Rules (The Verbs)
Figure out what the system needs to do. 
Digital Wallet rules: Users get 1 point for every 10 dollars spent. Cannot redeem points if balance is less than 100.
Inside App.java, replace old methods with this new logic.


            CHANGES IN VERB CODE                               

            public int calculateRewardPoints(Transaction tx) {
                if (tx == null || tx.getAmount() <= 0) {
                    return 0; 
                }
                return (int) (tx.getAmount() / 10); 
            }




Step 3: Write Tests (The Verification)
For every rule written in Step 2, write a test in AppTest.java. Think about the Happy Path (when things succeed) and the Edge Cases (when things fail).
Test ideas: A 5 dollar purchase yields 0 points. A 25 dollar purchase yields 2 points. Trying to redeem 50 points fails because 100 is the minimum.
Open AppTest.java, wipe the old tests, and write the new verification logic.


            CHANGES IN TEST CODE                               

            @Test
            public void testCalculateRewards() {
                App.Transaction tx = new App.Transaction(25.0, "PURCHASE");
                int points = app.calculateRewardPoints(tx);
                assertEquals(2, points); 
            }




Step 4: Infrastructure Files
Do not touch pom.xml, Dockerfile, Jenkinsfile, or deployment.yaml unless the exam specifically commands it. Maven will find the Java files and compile them automatically.


The Final Workflow 
1. Open App.java and delete old Nouns and Verbs.
2. Write in new Nouns and Verbs for the new scenario.
3. Open AppTest.java and delete old tests.
4. Write new tests proving the new logic works.
5. Run mvn clean test.
6. Run mvn clean package.
7. Configure Jenkins Credentials using your Docker Hub username and password.
give based on the scenario:
8. Build the Docker image: 'docker build -t praveen0210/grocery-delivery-system:latest' .'
9. Push the image to Docker Hub:'docker push praveen0210/grocery-delivery-system:latest'
10. Deploy the application to Kubernetes: 'kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml'
11. Verify the deployment and pods: 'kubectl get pods ,kubectl get svc'
